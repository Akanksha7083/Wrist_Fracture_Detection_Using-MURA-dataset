Dataset Preparation

This project uses the MURA v1.1 dataset released by the Stanford ML Group. It contains over 40,000 musculoskeletal X-ray images across 7 study types: elbow, finger, forearm, hand, humerus, shoulder, and wrist.
Since our focus is wrist fracture detection, we only extracted the wrist subset from the dataset.

Dataset Access

MURA can be downloaded from: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

My dataset is stored on Google Drive for training in Google Colab:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11pYC5W_bpntGuPTPkN14GOgDrlxg8J9b?usp=drive_link

Steps for Using the Dataset

1. Mount Google Drive in Colab

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

2. Load Train & Validation CSVs
The dataset provides CSV files with study paths and labels (0 = Normal, 1 = Fracture).
import pandas as pd

train_df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/MURA-v1.1/train_labeled_studies.csv', header=None)
valid_df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/MURA-v1.1/valid_labeled_studies.csv', header=None)

train_df.columns = ['study_path', 'label']
valid_df.columns = ['study_path', 'label']

3. Filter Only Wrist Studies
We only keep wrist X-rays using a string filter:

train_df = train_df[train_df['study_path'].str.contains('wrist', case=False)]
valid_df = valid_df[valid_df['study_path'].str.contains('wrist', case=False)]


4. Expand Study Paths to Image-Level Paths
Each study folder contains multiple X-ray images. To train at the image level, we expand the paths:

import os, glob

def expand_study_paths(df):
    images, labels, study_paths = [], [], []
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        folder = os.path.join('/content/drive/MyDrive', row['study_path'])
        paths = glob.glob(os.path.join(folder, '*.png'))
        for p in paths:
            images.append(p)
            labels.append(int(row['label']))
            study_paths.append(row['study_path'])
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'image_path': images,
        'study_path': study_paths,
        'label': labels
    })

train_expanded = expand_study_paths(train_df)
valid_expanded = expand_study_paths(valid_df)
